         You used to call me on my<br />
         You used to, you used to<br />
         Yeah<br />
<br />
         You used to call me on my cell phone<br />
         Late night when you need my love<br />
         Call me on my cell phone<br />
         Late night when you need my love<br />
         And I know when that hotline bling<br />
         That can only mean one thing<br />
         I know when that hotline bling<br />
         That can only mean one thing<br />
<br />
         Ever since I left the city,<br />
         You got a reputation for yourself now<br />
         Everybody knows and I feel left out<br />
         Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out<br />
         'Cause ever since I left the city,<br />
         you started wearing less and goin' out more<br />
         Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor<br />
         Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before<br />
<br />
         You used to call me on my cell phone<br />
         Late night when you need my love<br />
         Call me on my cell phone<br />
         Late night when you need my love<br />
         I know when that hotline bling<br />
         That can only mean one thing<br />
         I know when that hotline bling<br />
         That can only mean one thing<br />
<br />
         Ever since I left the city, you, you, you<br />
         You and me we just don't get along<br />
         You make me feel like I did you wrong<br />
         Going places where you don't belong<br />
         Ever since I left the city,<br />
         you, you got exactly what you asked for<br />
         Running out of pages in your passport<br />
         Hanging with some girls I've never seen before<br />
<br />
         You used to call me on my cell phone<br />
         Late night when you need my love<br />
         Call me on my cell phone<br />
         Late night when you need my love<br />
         And I know when that hotline bling<br />
         That can only mean one thing<br />
<br />
         These days, all I do is<br />
         Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else<br />
         Wonder if you're rollin' up a backwoods for someone else<br />
         Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else<br />
         You don't need no one else<br />
         You don't need nobody else, no<br />
         Why you never alone<br />
         Why you always touching road<br />
         Used to always stay at home, be a good girl<br />
         You was in a zone, yeah<br />
         You should just be yourself<br />
         Right now, you're someone else<br />
<br />
         You used to call me on my cell phone<br />
         Late night when you need my love<br />
         Call me on my cell phone<br />
         Late night when you need my love<br />
         And I know when that hotline bling<br />
         That can only mean one thing<br />
         I know when that hotline bling<br />
         That can only mean one thing<br />
<br />
         Ever since I left the city<br />
